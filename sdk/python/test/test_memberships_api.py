    Whop SaaS Marketplace API

    Production-grade marketplace API enabling multi-tenant SaaS, Stripe Connect payments, license management, and webhook event broadcasting.  ## Authentication All endpoints require authentication via session token cookie (`session_token`).  ## Multi-Tenancy All resources are scoped to companies. Users can access multiple companies with different roles.  ## Rate Limiting - 100 requests per minute per IP - Returns `429 Too Many Requests` when exceeded  ## Security - Tenant isolation via `company_id` filtering - Role-based access control (owner/admin/member) - Money stored in minor units (cents) to avoid floating-point errors
